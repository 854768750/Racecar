remember to always source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

1) run gazebo launch file

   roslaunch racecar_gazebo racecar_tunnel.launch

2) connect odom and base_link:

   rosrun tf statitransform_publisher 0 0 0 0 0 0 odom base_link 100

3)  run steps from f1/10 to start RVIZ but use updated version of tutorial.launch:

  roscd hector_slam_launch/launch/
  roslaunch hector_slam_launch tutorial.launch

4) save tf frames in a pdf:
  rosrun tf view_frames

5) save map :
  rosrun map_server map_saver -f mymap


RESULT:
  -map is built

ERROR: map is not accurate. see error message from RVIZ below:

  -Transform failed during publishing of map_odom transform: Lookup would require      	   extrapolation into the future.  Requested time 258.785000000 but the latest data is at  time 258.404000000, when looking up transform from frame [base_link] to frame [nav]
