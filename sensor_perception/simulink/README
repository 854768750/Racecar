Simulink model for testing self-adapitive system with object tracking algorithms.


## Import/Open a Model ##

1. Open Simulink in matlab
2. each file with extension ".slx" is a model
3. "open"-> model/***.slx

## Code Generation ##
Select "Deploy to hardware" in an opened model
Generated code would be saved as ***.tgz file

## Build&Run ##
Using an existed .tgz file in code_generation or code generated by a model.

$ ./build_ros_model.sh [***.tgz] [your/ros/workspace]
$ source your/ros/workspace/devel/setup.bash
Using rosrun to run the standalone ros node.

## raw_image_sender ##
The model should subscribe sensor.msg/Image messages from a topic (/image_bridge).
raw_image_sender is a simple ros node to capture video stream from /dev/video0 then publish images to /image_bridge
