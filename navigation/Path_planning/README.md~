Field Testing the robot

Run each step in different terminals when connecting via ssh

1) run slam node. Note this launch file is in the F1tenth GitHub repo in the Slam_Launch directory.

$ roslaunch hector_slam_launch tutorial.launch 

2) run path planner node and enter start and stop coordinates when prompted. Note that the starting point(origin) of the robot is 1024, 1024.

$ rosrun race rrt_planner.py

3) Drive the car manually to build a map using either the joystick node or keyboard node. Both can be launched with the launch file in step 1.

Alternatively, manually control the robot using the keyboard node:
$ rosrun race keyboard.py

4) Run the pure pursuit controller node. This will control the car to follow the path produced by the path planner. Ctrl+C will exit the node and reset the steer and speed values to 0.

$ rosrun race pure_pursuit_controllor_<latest rev>.py
